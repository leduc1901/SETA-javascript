- Second Loop : Find the length that has the most element in array
- Third Loop : Find and return the array contains elements that have the most occurence in length

Task 2 Solution
Complexity : O(n^2)
The solution is pretty simple, just sort the array then return the sums of two largest number ( two last element )
